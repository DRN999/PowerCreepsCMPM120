This is a very basic prototype of the game(stealth action game) that we are going to start off with. The graphics are beyond 
simple and they are only placeholders to replace later with. 

Thing that will be improved on in later product:
- more precise collision detection with p2 physics rather than arcade physics(it would be rather annoying for the player to 
dealth with an enourmous square hit box)
- a more complicated AI for the moving enemies that will more resemble a stealth action type game
- the AI will have a couple of basic moving that will happen randomly or when a certain event occurs 

The game will be a stealth action game with the objective to survive and not get found by these enemies 
The game will give multiple options along the way that will alter the ending of the game.
